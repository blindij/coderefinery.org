### Workshop for present and future instructors

Do you (want to) teach researchers or independent students best
practices of scientific software?
Are you teaching a university course and would like to include
aspects of best practices in software engineering in the course?
Or would you simply like to educate your friends and colleagues in
how to write more reusable, reproducible and better documented code?

If you answered yes to any of the above questions, we welcome you to
join the first CodeRefinery instructor training workshop! This workshop
will focus on how to teach technical topics (e.g. version control with
Git, automated testing or programming languages) in general, and
CodeRefinery lessons in particular. We will cover key pedagogical ideas
and teaching methods, and what you need to know in order to teach the
CodeRefinery lessons. All the material will be firmly grounded in the
experience that CodeRefinery staff has acquired after teaching over 25
workshops to over 600 participants and the published best practices of
the Software Carpentry organization.

One purpose of this workshop is to train CodeRefinery instructors, but
being (or becoming) a CodeRefinery instructor is not required.  People
are equally welcome to learn our tips and tricks and join our informal
Nordic network. Put another way: *anyone involved in improving the
quality of research code should be here!*

#### Tuesday, April 21

The second day is focused on going through lessons to revise and develop teaching
strategies. The goal of this day is to review objectives, keypoints, and exercises,
to identify sections/exercises that could be optional, and to adjust timing.

Each lesson discussion is led by 2-3 CodeRefiners. Their task is to prepare
the following in the instructor guides before these sessions: 1) Why do we
teach this lesson, 2) intended learning outcomes, and 3) how it is presented.
